    <p>Ronald Koeman (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈroːnɑlt ˈkumɑn] (About this soundlisten);
        born 21 March 1963) is a Dutch professional football manager and former player,
        who is the current head coach of La Liga club FC Barcelona. He is the younger
        brother of his former international teammate Erwin Koeman and the son of
        former Dutch international Martin Koeman. Koeman was capable of playing
        both as a defender and as a midfielder; he frequently played as a sweeper,
        although he was equally known for his goalscoring, long–range shooting, and
        accuracy from free kicks and penalties. Born in Zaandam, Koeman began
        his career at FC Groningen before transferring to the Netherlands' most
        successful club Ajax, where he won the national Eredivisie title in 1984–85.
        He then joined Ajax's rivals PSV, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles
        (1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89) and the European Cup in 1988. Ronald Koeman is
        one of five European players to ever win a Treble with their club and a cup
        with their national team in the same year. The other four players are his
        teammates Hans van Breukelen, Berry van Aerle, Gerald Vanenburg and Wim Kieft.
        In 1989, Koeman moved to Barcelona and became part of Johan Cruyff's
        "Dream Team", helping the club win La Liga four years in a row between 1991
        and 1994, and the European Cup, where he scored the winning goal of the
        final against Sampdoria in 1992.</p>
