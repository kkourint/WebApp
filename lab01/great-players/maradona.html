    <p>Diego Armando Maradona (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo maɾaˈðona];
        30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional football
        player and manager. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the
        history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player
        of the 20th Century award.[3][4] Maradona's vision, passing, ball control,
        and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him
        a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other
        players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on
        his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the
        opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for
        goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A precocious talent,
        Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a
        name that stuck with him throughout his career.[5] He also had a troubled
        off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.[6]
        An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position,
        Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice:
        in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for £5 million, and in 1984 when
        he moved to Napoli for a fee of £6.9 million.[7] He played for Argentinos
        Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell's Old Boys
        during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli and Barcelona,
        where he won numerous accolades.</p>
