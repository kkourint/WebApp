        <h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
        <p>Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi]
            (About this soundlisten);[A] born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional
            footballer who plays as a forward and captains both the Spanish club
            Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best
            player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players
            of all time, Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a
            record six European Golden Shoes. He has spent his entire professional
            career with Barcelona, where he has won a club-record 33 trophies,
            including ten La Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles and six
            Copas del Rey. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds
            the records for most goals in La Liga (455), a La Liga and European league
            season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions
            League (8), and most assists in La Liga (185), a La Liga and European
            league season (21)[9] and the Copa América (12). He has scored over 700
            senior career goals for club and country.Born and raised in central
            Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13,
            for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004.
            He established himself as an integral player for the club within
            the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09
            he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football;
            that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful
            seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or,
            aking him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.[10]
            During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for
            most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as
            Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi
            finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo
            (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during
            the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and
            leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was
            awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed the captaincy of
            Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured a record sixth Ballon d'Or.</p>
