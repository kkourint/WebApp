    <p>Samuel Eto'o Fils (French pronunciation: ​[samɥɛl eto fis]; born 10 March 1981)
        is a Cameroonian retired professional footballer who played as a striker.
        In his prime, Eto'o was regarded by pundits as one of the best strikers in
        the world,[5] and he is regarded as one of the greatest African players of
        all time,[6] winning the African Player of the Year a record four times: in 2003
        , 2004, 2005, and 2010. A precocious talent, Eto'o moved to Real Madrid as a
        16 year old. Due to competition in his position with more experienced players,
        he had several loan spells, before signing for Mallorca in 2000 where he
        scored 70 goals. His impressive form saw him join Barcelona in 2004 where
        he scored 130 goals in five seasons and also became the record holder for the
        most number of appearances by an African player in La Liga.[7] Winning La Liga
        three times, he was a key member of the Barcelona attack, alongside Ronaldinho,
        that won the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final, with Eto'o scoring in the final,
        and was part of a front three of Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry that won the 2009
        UEFA Champions League Final, with Eto'o again scoring in the final.
        He is the second player in history to score in two UEFA Champions League finals.
        At Barcelona, Eto'o came in third for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2005
        and was twice named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI, in 2005 and 2006.</p>
