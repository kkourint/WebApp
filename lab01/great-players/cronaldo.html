    <h2>About Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation:
        [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional
        footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains
        the Portugal national team.
        Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of
        the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards
        [note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, both of which are records for
        a European player. He has won 30 major trophies in his career, including
        seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European
        Championship, and one UEFA Nations League title. Ronaldo holds the records
        for the most goals (134) and assists (41) in the history of the UEFA Champions
        League.[11] He is one of the few recorded players to have made over
        1,000 professional career appearances and has scored over 750 senior career
        goals for club and country.[12] He is also the second male athlete to
        score 100 international goals, and the first European man to achieve the
        feat.[13] Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career
        playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003,
        aged 18. After winning the FA Cup in his first season, he helped United
        win three successive Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League,
        and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009,
        Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football
        transfer when signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €94 million
        (£80 million). There, he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles,
        two Copas del Rey, and four UEFA Champions League titles, and became
        the club's all-time top goalscorer. After joining Madrid, Ronaldo
        finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel
        Messi—his perceived career rival—before winning back-to-back Ballons d'Or
        from 2013–2014 and again from 2016–2017. After winning a third consecutive
        Champions League title in 2018, Ronaldo became the first player to win
        the trophy five times.[14] In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer
        worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the highest fee ever paid
        by an Italian club and the highest ever paid for a player over 30 years old.
        He won the Serie A title in his first two seasons with the club.</p>
