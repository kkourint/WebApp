        <h2>What is Soccer?</h2>
        <p>Soccer, also know as football outside of the Unites
           States is a sport game played with a spherical ball
           between two teams of eleven players each. Today,
           soccer is played in approximately 200 countries and
           dependencies around the world. When i was growing,
           i loved soccer and spent most of my free time playing.
           My father even thought that i will become a professional
           player and kept encouraging me in practicing. But because
           of the uncertainty in the professional sport business,
           i decided to rather focus on my studies. Even though i
           did not play professional, i continue to play as part
           of my work out and also for fun. My favorite team is barcelona,
           a team i have been watching since my teenage years. On this
           website, i will be posting things about soccer, what i do
           and also news about my favorite team, Barcelona</p>
        <h3>Let's take a look at my favorite football Club</h3>
